# sparse-learning-analytics
A repository for final research project for my Master's Degree. 

# Introduction

In this work, a scalable web application applying Text Mining and unsupervised learning
techniques will be developed and evaluated. Through the use machine learning based analytics
methods such as Sparse Factor Analysis (SparFA), in conjunction with unsupervised
learning methods this project will aim to generate course-concept associations that will be
pivotal in future course and curriculum design. The performance of machine learning and
analytics in the field of Learning Analytics is widely known to be effective in online class
structures. However this application will be applied to a primarily in-person University.
This allows these methods to be applied to potentially better advise students in University
coursework for their long term goals by alleviating the pressure of learning a vast set of
concepts from courses in which they might only need a small fraction of. The focus on
this project will be the course catalog at Florida Polytechnic University, where Documentterm
matrices, course-concept association graphs, and dimensionality reduction methods
will be constructed to investigate the future of catalogue design, while pointing students
toward important associations between their current coursework and weaknesses they may
have in other concepts. The insights gained from this research project will help drive future
developments and iterations on the application to aid in the Universityâ€™s rapid development.
