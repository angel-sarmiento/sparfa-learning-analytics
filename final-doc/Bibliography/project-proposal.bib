	abstract = {Students in online courses generate large amounts of data that can be used to personalize the learning process and improve quality of education. The goal of this work is to develop a statistical model of students and educational content that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as adaptive lesson sequencing and learning analytics. We formulate this problem as a regularized maximum-likelihood embedding of students, lessons, and assessments from historical student-module interactions. Akin to collaborative ﬁltering for recommender systems, the algorithm does not require students or modules to be described by features, but it learns a representation using access traces. An empirical evaluation on large-scale data from Knewton, an adaptive learning technology company, shows that this approach predicts assessment results more accurately than baseline models and is able to discriminate between lesson sequences that lead to mastery and failure.},
