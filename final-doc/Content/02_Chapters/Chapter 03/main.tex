This work starts with the collection of University course information from the entire course catalog at Florida Polytechnic University.  
This provided, courses, concepts, plans of study, number of credits, and course descriptions. Once retrieved, a document-term matrix was created with rows 
representing topics, and columns representing the course where the word/bigram appears. This matrix was used in a dimensionality reduction method such as Multiple 
Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to generate biplots where clusters of topics can be identified. A process for a network analysis was then created to allow for instructions 
to provide examples of interest for all levels of proficiency and background. This process created a concept-courses association graph that can be used as a measure for 
verifying connections across topics/questions. This can enable incremental learning through successive iterations.
