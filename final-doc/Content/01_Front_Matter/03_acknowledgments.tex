\begin{acknowledgments}
This work would not have been possible without the patience and support of my mentor and advisor, Dr. Reinaldo Sanchez-Arias. His example of excellence at what he does, as well as the patience and support in helping me figure who I am in this field, \\
are once in a lifetime contributions that I will never take for granted. I hope my dedication and commitment can meet and exceed even a fraction of yours some day.

Thanks to Dr. Shahram Taj who graciously agreed to be a part of the committee and gave me relevant feedback to better my work.

I would like to thank Florida Polytechnic University for their support, both in the form of scholarships and in the community that they foster on campus. I look forward to returning to campus and seeing how our small school is making a big impact.
