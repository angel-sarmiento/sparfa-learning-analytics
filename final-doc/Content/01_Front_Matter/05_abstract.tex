\begin{abstract}

In this work,  a series of investigations involving Text Mining and Unsupervised learning techniques were developed and evaluated.  Through the use machine learning based analytics methods such as Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation this project aimed to generate course-concept associations that can be pivotal in future course and curriculum design. The performance of machine learning and analytics in the field of Learning Analytics is widely known to be effective in online class structures. However this application will be applied to a primarily in-person University. This allows these methods to be applied to potentially better advise students in University coursework for their long term goals by alleviating the pressure of learning a vast set of concepts from courses in which they might only need a small fraction of. The focus on this project was the course catalog at Florida Polytechnic University, where Document-term matrices, course-concept association graphs, and dimensionality reduction methods were constructed to investigate the future of catalogue design,  by unifying courses by their text information.  The work generated reusable templates with open-source technologies for applying these methodologies across the entire catalog with dynamic package management for reproducibility. This can be used for further analysis for planning course work and catalogs, while pointing students toward important associations between their current coursework and weaknesses they may have in other concepts.  This work highlights the techniques described above, along with a case study of different distance methods and their ability to segment courses into groupings.  The insights gained from this research project will help drive future developments and iterations on the application to aid in the University's rapid development.
